        "The problem I try to expplore is \"where is the best location for a new KFC in Jurong west area of Singapore\". I am student studing that area and want to start my bussiness- opening a KFC. when i am choosing the location, I have following question: Should I place my KFC in a place where there are a lot of existing KFCs or in a place where there is none or should I try to find some balance between these two extremes?\n",

        "For the problem I will: 1) find the exsiting KFCs in Jurong west and identify them visually on a map; 2) create several \"clusters\" of these KFCs to identfiy potential locations for me to choose. I need choose one from these business locations and locate my new KFC in the center of it. \n",
        "\n",
        "We should use the \"explore\" endpoint. The request url is \"https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore\" According to the document, in the request, we should pass following parameters: \"section=KFC\" and \"near=jurong west\". In the response, we are interested in groups.items.categories, groups.items.venue.name, group.items.venue.location. To simplify the problem, we will only use the geographic location to cluster the KFCs.\n"
